-- 1. In a similar manner to the function a d d, define a recursive multiplication function
-- mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat for the recursive type of natural numbers:
-- Hint: make use of add in your definition.

-- 2. Although not included in appendix B, the standard prelude defines
-- data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
-- together with a function
-- compare :: Ord a => a -> a -> Ordering
-- that decides if one value in an ordered type is less than (L T), equal to (E Q),
-- or greater than (G T) another value. Using this function, redefine the function
-- occurs :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Bool for search trees. Why is this
-- new definition more efficient than the original version?

-- 3. Consider the following type of binary trees:
-- data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
-- Let us say that such a tree is balanced if the number of leaves in the left and
-- right subtree of every node differs by at most one, with leaves themselves being trivially balanced. 
-- Define a function balanced :: Tree a -> Bool that
-- decides if a binary tree is balanced or not.
-- Hint: first define a function that returns the number of leaves in a tree.

-- 4. Define a function b a l a n c e : : [ a ] - > T r e e a that converts a non-empty
-- list into a balanced tree. Hint: first define a function that splits a list into two
-- halves whose length differs by at most one.

-- 5. Given the type declaration
-- d a t a E x p r = V a l I n t | A d d E x p r E x p r
-- define a higher-order function
-- folde :: (Int -> a) -> (a -> a -> a) -> Expr -> a
-- such that folde f g replaces each V a l constructor in an expression by the
-- function f, and each A d d constructor by the function g.

-- 6. Using f o l d e, define a function eval :: Expr -> Int that evaluates an expression to an integer value, 
-- and a function size :: Expr -> Int that calculates the number of values in an expression.

-- 7. Complete the following instance declarations:
-- instance Eq a = > Eq (Maybe a) where
-- ...
-- instance Eq a => Eq [a] where
-- ...

-- 8. Extend the tautology checker to support the use of logical disjunction (_)
-- and equivalence (Ã´) in propositions.
-- 9. Extend the abstract machine to support the use of multiplication.
